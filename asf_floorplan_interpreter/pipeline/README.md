# :house: Floorplan Interpreter

In this directory is the code to:

- Create floorplan labelling tasks - see [the Prodigy folder README](asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/annotation/README.md)
- Train a model to predict segments in floorplans - `train_yolo.py`
- Use these models to predict segments - `predict_floorplan.py`
- Evaluate the pipeline - see [the evaluation folder README](asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/evaluation/README.md)

## ðŸ”¨ High level usage

You can quickly load the trained models and make predictions on a floor plan url using the following code:

```
from asf_floorplan_interpreter.pipeline.predict_floorplan import FloorplanPredictor

img = 'outputs/figures/floorplan.png'

fp = FloorplanPredictor(labels_to_predict = ["WINDOW", "DOOR","KITCHEN", "LIVING", "RESTROOM", "BEDROOM", "GARAGE"])
fp.load(local=True)
labels, label_counts = fp.predict_labels(img)
fp.plot(img, labels, "outputs/figures/floorplan_prediction.png", plot_label=False)

```

`label_counts` will give the counts of each label, in this case `{'DOOR': 12, 'WINDOW': 10, 'LIVING': 2, 'KITCHEN': 2, 'BEDROOM': 3, 'RESTROOM': 1}`.

The image created will look like the following.

## Training data

### ðŸ¤– Roboflow data

There is [an existing annotation dataset of UK floorplans](https://universe.roboflow.com/prop/room-separation-instance/dataset/5) on Roboflow. This consists of:

- Training = 1454 images
- Validation = 65 images
- Test = 54 images

This dataset contains polygon annotations with 6 classes:

1. Door
2. Double door
3. Folding door
4. Room
5. Sliding door
6. Window

This dataset is stored on S3 [here](s3://asf-floorplan-interpreter/data/roboflow_data/).

### ðŸ’¥ Our own labelled data

We created datasets of labelled data using Prodigy - see more about this process in [the Prodigy folder README](asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/annotation/README.md). These are:

1. Labelling rooms (`room_dataset.jsonl`).
2. Labelling doors, windows and staircases (`window_door_staircase.jsonl`).
3. Labelling room types from the room labels (`room_type_dataset.jsonl`).

To convert these Prodigy labels to format needed for YOLO, run:

```
python asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/prodigy_to_yolo.py
```

This will output the images and the labels in various S3 locations.

### :file_folder: Roboflow plus our own labelled data for windows and doors

Run

```
python asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/merge_prodigy_roboflow.py
```

to merge the windows and door labels from the Roboflow dataset and the Prodigy dataset. This will output data to `data/annotation/prodigy_labelled/131123/yolo_formatted/window_door_prodigy_plus_roboflow` and will take some time to run.

Any other classes other than windows and doors will be removed from the labelled dataset.

## :muscle: Training

The pre-trained YOLOv8m model for instance segmentation (docs) can be trained with our newly annotated data using metaflow, by running:

```
cd asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/
python train_yolo.py --package-suffixes=.txt,.yaml,.jpg --datastore=s3 run --config_file configs/CONFIG_NAME.yaml
```

This will train the model and output the best model in [this S3 location](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/asf-floorplan-interpreter?region=eu-west-2&prefix=window_door_config/&showversions=false).

If you want to get the model and the evaluation files locally from a model you have trained run:

```
aws s3 sync s3://asf-floorplan-interpreter/models/{MODEL_NAME}/ models/{MODEL_NAME}/

```

where `MODEL_NAME` will be the name of the config file you used to train the model, plus any suffix that was given in this config, e.g. `window_door_config_yolov8m_wd`.

The metaflow files are in this location: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/open-jobs-lake?prefix=metaflow/FloorPlanYolo/&region=eu-west-1

### ðŸ““ Configs

Note that for Batch to work, the configs need to be in the same folder as `train_yolo.py` - hence why we store them in the `configs/` folder rather than elsewhere in this repo.

To train each model a pair of configs are needed; the main config (e.g. `room_config.yaml`) and the config neccessary for training using YOLO (`yolo_room_config.yaml`). The latter is referenced in the former, so when you run `train_yolo.py` you only need the first config in the argument.

The main configs to choose from are:

1. `configs/roboflow_config.yaml`: To train a model to identify doors, windows and rooms using the Roboflow dataset.
2. `configs/room_config.yaml`: To train a model that will identify rooms using our labelled dataset.
3. `configs/window_door_config.yaml`: To train a model that will identify windows, and doors using our labelled dataset plus that from Roboflow.
4. `configs/staircase_config.yaml`: To train a model to identify staircases
5. `configs/room_type_config.yaml`: To train a model to identify specific room types ("RESTROOM", "BEDROOM", "KITCHEN", "LIVING", "GARAGE", "OTHER")

There are also test versions of some of these which will run more quickly `configs/roboflow_test_config.yaml` and `configs/room_test_config.yaml`.

e.g.

```
python train_yolo.py --package-suffixes=.txt,.yaml,.jpg --datastore=s3 run --config_file configs/roboflow_test_config.yaml
```

The Yolo configs are in a specific format and include two variables which need setting according to your task. For example in the roboflow config:

```
path: "data/roboflow_data/"
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test
save_dir: "roboflow_save_dir/"

nc: 6
names: ["DOOR", "DOUBLE DOOR", "FOLDING DOOR", "ROOM", "SLIDING DOOR", "WINDOW"]

```

we provide the paths to the training, test and validation sets (i.e. `data/roboflow_data/images/train` etc), as well as telling YOLO we want to train 6 class (`nc` = number of classes) and the names of these 6 classes (`names`). Yolo will then map each class to a number. The names of the classes should map to what's in the training datasets (i.e if class 2 was "folding door" then `names` should have folding door as the 2nd element.

### Trained models

The trained models we use in evaluation and prediction are the following:

- `models/window_door_config_yolov8m_wd/`
- `models/room_config_yolov8m/`
- `models/staircase_config_yolov8m/`
- `models/room_type_config_yolov8m/`
