## Train a model to recognise doors and windows

## :file_folder: Roboflow data

There is [an existing annotation dataset of UK floorplans](https://universe.roboflow.com/prop/room-separation-instance/dataset/5) on Roboflow.
This consists of:

- Training = 1454 images
- val = 65 images
- test = 54

Polygon annotation with 6 classes:

1. Door
2. Double door
3. Folding door
4. Room
5. Sliding door
6. Window

This dataset is stored on S3 [here](s3://asf-floorplan-interpreter/data/roboflow_data/).

Warning: ultralytics requires the parent data folder to be called "datasets".

## :file_folder: Our own labelled data

We created datasets of labelled data using Prodigy.

1. Labelling rooms (`room_dataset.jsonl`).
2. Labelling doors, windows and staircases (`window_door_staircase.jsonl`).
3. A manually checked and corrected version of 100 labelled doors, windows and staircases (`check_window_door_staircase.jsonl`).

To create the yolo-formatted datasets from labelled data using Prodigy, run:

```
python asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/prodigy_to_yolo.py
```

This will output the images and the labels in various S3 locations.

## :file_folder: Roboflow plus our own labelled data for windows and doors

Run

```

python asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/merge_prodigy_roboflow.py
```

to merge the windows and door labels from the Roboflow dataset and the Prodigy dataset. This will output data to `data/annotation/prodigy_labelled/191023/yolo_formatted/window_door_prodigy_plus_roboflow` and will take some time to run.

Any other classes other than windows and doors will be removed from the labelled dataset.

## :muscle: Training

Train: YOLOV8n (smallest) for instance segmentation (docs) using metaflow:

```
cd asf_floorplan_interpreter/pipeline/
python train_yolo.py --package-suffixes=.txt,.yaml,.jpg --datastore=s3 run --config_file configs/CONFIG_NAME.yaml
```

This will train the model and output the best model in [this S3 location](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/asf-floorplan-interpreter?region=eu-west-2&prefix=window_door_config/&showversions=false).

If you want to get the model and the evaluation files locally from a model you have trained run:

```
aws s3 sync s3://asf-floorplan-interpreter/models/window_door_config_yolov8m_wd/ window_door_config_yolov8m_wd/

```

The metaflow files are in this location: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/open-jobs-lake?prefix=metaflow/FloorPlanYolo/&region=eu-west-1

### ðŸ““ Configs

Note that for Batch to work, the configs need to be in the same folder as `train_yolo.py` - hence why we store them in the `configs/` folder rather than elsewhere in this repo.

To train each model a pair of configs are needed; the main config (e.g. `room_config.yaml`) and the config neccessary for training using YOLO (`yolo_room_config.yaml`). The latter is referenced in the former, so when you run `train_yolo.py` you only need the first config in the argument.

The main configs to choose from are:

1. `configs/roboflow_config.yaml`: To train a model to identify doors, windows and rooms using the Roboflow dataset.
2. `configs/room_config.yaml`: To train a model that will identify rooms using our labelled dataset.
3. `configs/window_door_config.yaml`: To train a model that will identify windows, and doors using our labelled dataset plus that from Roboflow.

There are also test versions of some of these which will run more quickly `configs/roboflow_test_config.yaml` and `configs/room_test_config.yaml`.

e.g.

```
python train_yolo.py --package-suffixes=.txt,.yaml,.jpg --datastore=s3 run --config_file configs/roboflow_test_config.yaml
```

The Yolo configs are in a specific format and include two variables which need setting according to your task. For example in the roboflow config:

```
path: "data/roboflow_data/"
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test
save_dir: "roboflow_save_dir/"

nc: 6
names: ["DOOR", "DOUBLE DOOR", "FOLDING DOOR", "ROOM", "SLIDING DOOR", "WINDOW"]

```

we provide the paths to the training, test and validation sets (i.e. `data/roboflow_data/images/train` etc), as well as telling YOLO we want to train 6 class (`nc` = number of classes) and the names of these 6 classes (`names`). Yolo will then map each class to a number. The names of the classes should map to what's in the training datasets (i.e if class 2 was "folding door" then `names` should have folding door as the 2nd element.

## Trained models

- `models/window_door_config_yolov8m_wd/`: This is the model trained on around 100 floorplans labelled using Prodigy, plus the RoboFlow dataset. Only window and door classes are used and trained.
- `models/room_config_yolov8m/`: This is the model trained on rooms annotated in around 100 floorplans labelled using Prodigy.
